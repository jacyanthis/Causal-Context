# Causal Context (NeurIPS 2023)

Repository with code to reproduce the semi-synthetic experiments from "Causal Context Connects Counterfactual Fairness to Group Fairness and Robust Prediction.” Please see our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/XXXX.XXXXX.pdf) for details.

## Getting Started
You could start by cloning the repository with the following commands.
```
git clone https://github.com/JacyAnthis/Causal-Context.git
cd Causal-Context
```

Then you need only run `experiment.py` to produce the results. It should take around 30 minutes on a personal laptop or Google Colab.

```
python experiment.py
```
